            <p>I am a 32 year old male currently residing in San Antonio, Texas. Soon, I will be moving to Seguin, Texas.  I have a beautiful, smart, supportive and loving girlfriend.  The rest of my family consists of a goofy dog and a cat that is usually up to no good.  I am from Kaysville, Utah which is a small town about 25 minutes north of Salt Lake City.  I am; however, indescribely happy that life brought me to Texas.
                 </p>

            <p>My background is in multi-family property maintenance.  After six years of learning a menagerie of useful skills with my hands, I began to hear and read about web development online. When the Fullstack Web-Developer Bootcamp at UTSA ad popped up on my computer one day, I decided to make a change. Computers have always been a part of my life, I love to play video games and I've used social web-based technologies since I was a teenager.  Jumping into this program was so intimidating for me at first as it has been 13 years since I have last pursued higher education in a classroom setting.  However, after working with the pre-work which the program provided, I am feeling beyond confident. I can not wait to achieve success and reach my educational, proffesional and personal goals.
